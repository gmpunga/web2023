        <p>we will use this podcast to share truth,
         creativity and encouragement with listeners to nurture,
        heal and inspire them â€” and in doing so, 
        help make the world a better and more empathetic place. Also,
        the podcast can be used as a tool for personal growth and empowerment,
        as it encourages listeners to think critically and to challenge their own perspectives and beliefs.
        The show's content can inspire listeners to become more engaged and informed persons,
        and to make a difference in their life.</p>

        <p>The website provides a platform for listeners to access and subscribe to the podcast, 
        view show notes and episode descriptions, listen to past episodes, 
        and connect with the hosts and other listeners. Additionally, 
        a podcast website can serve as a marketing tool for promoting
        the show and growing its audience. Some podcast websites also offer monetization opportunities,
        such as offering premium content, sponsorships, and merchandise sales. The website can also act 
        as a portfolio for the hosts, showcasing their work and serving as a hub for their personal brand..</p>
